  VireonOS Beta - Full Demo (C++98 / Dev-C++ 5.11)

  Description:
    VireonOS Beta is a Polish project simulating a DOS-like console operating system.
    The system features:
      - Interactive shell with commands and WSM GUI
      - Installer with selectable applications and environments
      - ASCII applications: Paint, Notes, MusicPlayer, Calculator, mini-games
      - ASCII Browser and YouTube demo with animations
      - Process monitor (htop-like) and system logs
      - Color-coded prompts, ASCII borders, loading animations

 This project was created with the assistance of AI (OpenAI GPT-5 mini), which helped with adding logos to the system as part of an experimental retro operating system simulation.
 
  Version:
    VireonOS Beta - Kernel Beta
    Phase: Beta (Not for production)
    Developed for: Dev-C++ 5.11 (C++98 compatible)

  Disclaimer:
    This is a demo project for educational and entertainment purposes only.

  Future Plans:
    - Expand ASCII applications with more interactive features
    - Add more environments and GUI customization
    - Improve browser and YouTube demos with additional animations
    - Introduce new system utilities and mini-games
    - Overall expansion to make the beta system more complete
